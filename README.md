# Password Generator - Scrimba Course exercise

A password generator exercise that creates strong, random passwords. The application employs JavaScript's Math.random() method to generate passwords of varying lengths (5, 10, or 15 characters) using a combination of letters and special characters. Users can instantly copy the generated password to their clipboard by clicking a button, which uses the JavaScript function navigator.clipboard.writeText().
